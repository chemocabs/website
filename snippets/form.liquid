  Shopify Form Snippet Bridge
  This snippet serves as a fallback or custom rendering point for Shopify Forms.
  It expects a 'form' variable (the form ID or handle).
{%- endcomment -%}

{%- if form != blank -%}
  <div class="shopify-app-form-wrapper" data-form-id="{{ form }}">
    {%- comment -%} 
      Note: Most modern Shopify Forms are rendered via App Blocks.
      If this snippet is used, ensure the Shopify Forms app script is loaded.
    {%- endcomment -%}
    <div id="shopify-form-{{ form | handleize }}"></div>
  </div>
{%- else -%}
  <p class="form-error">No form ID provided to the form snippet.</p>
{%- endif -%}
